This repository contains the implementation for [GS-WGAN: A Gradient-Sanitized Approach for Learning Differentially Private Generators (NeurIPS 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08265).

## Requirements 
The environment can be set up using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) with the following commands:

``` setup
conda create --name gswgan-pytorch python=3.6
conda activate gswgan-pytorch
conda install pytorch=1.2.0 
conda install torchvision -c pytorch
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<!---Please note that modifications in registering the `backward_hook` (in `source/main.py`) may be required if you plan to use a different pytorch version. Please refer to the [pytorch document](https://pytorch.org/docs/versions.html) (select pytorch version &rarr; `torch.nn` &rarr;  `Module` &rarr; search for `register_backward_hook`) for more information.---> 

## Training 
#### Step 1. To warm-start the discriminators:
```warm-start
cd source
sh pretrain.sh
```
- To run the training in parallel: adjust the 
`'meta_start'` argument and run the script multiple times in parallel.
- Alternatively, you can download the pre-trained models using the links [below](#pre-trained-models). 
   
#### Step 2. To train the differentially private generator:
```train
cd source
python main.py -data 'mnist' -name 'ResNet_default' -ldir '../results/mnist/pretrain/ResNet_default'
```
- Please refer to `source/config.py` (or execute `python main.py -h`) for the complete list of arguments. 

- The default setting require ~22G GPU memory. Please allocate multiple GPUs by specifying the `'-ngpus'` argument if   it does not fit in the memory of one GPU. 

## Evaluation
#### Privacy
- To compute the privacy cost:
    ```privacy 
    cd evaluation
    python privacy_analysis.py -data 'mnist' -name 'ResNet_default'
    ```

## Pre-trained Models
Pre-trained model checkpoints can be downloaded using the links below. The discriminators are obtained after the 
warm-starting step (step 1), while the generators are obtained after the DP training step (step 2). 
The pre-trained models are stored as `.pth` files and the corresponding training configurations are stored in 
`params.pkl` and `params.txt`.
